<!-- Block elements take up the complete width of the screen, thus blocks 
out the display of any other element -->

<!--````````````````````````````````````Inline```````````````````````````````````````` -->

<!-- Inline display takes only the needed space as in case of span, anchor etc..,
they keep stacking in front of each other -->
<!-- We cannot control the width of inline -->

<!-- ``````````````````````````````````Inline-Block``````````````````````````````````` -->

<!-- Inline-Block allow you to change the width of the element, but initially its width is as
that of the content -->

<!-- ``````````````````````````````````display:none;``````````````````````````````````` -->

<!-- Deletes the element from its position,as if its was never written in the code. -->

<!-- #####################################--CSS Positning--################################### -->

<!-- 
  Position:  Static(default), Relative, Absolute, Fixed

  Relative- Suppose it was initially present somewhere,
            when its position is set to relative, we can use left, right, top, bottom 
            to move it relative to its original position.

            IMPORTANT--
            1)When the element is moved by making it relative, it does not affect the position or 
            the configration of other elements.
            2)When we use the prop. like top, bottom, left, right we are kinda giving a margin
            to it relative to its original posiiton.

  Absolute- We are positioning the element w.r.t to its parent element for eg;
            if we have an image inside a div the left, right, top, bottom prop. are used w.r.t the div.

            When the element is moved from its position the other elements will take up its 
            space, as if it was never present there.
